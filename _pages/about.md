<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I’m a **M.S. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering (Machine Learning and Data Science)** at **UC San Diego**, where I focus on **Generative AI**, **Multimodal Reasoning**, and **AI Safety**. 
Previously, I earned my **B.Eng. in Intelligent Science and Technology** from **Sun Yat-sen University**, with a GPA of **3.8/4.0** (upper-division 4.0/4.0).

# 🔬 Research Interests

My research focuses on **unified multimodal generative models**, particularly on bridging **text and image generation** to achieve semantic alignment and mutual enhancement between modalities.
 I am also interested in **AI safety and robustness**, studying how large models can remain reliable and secure under adversarial or backdoor conditions.
