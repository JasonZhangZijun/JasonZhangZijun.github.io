<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Master's student in **Electrical and Computer Engineering** at **UC San Diego**, specializing in **Machine Learning and Data Science**. I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree from **Sun Yat-sen University**, majoring in **Intelligent Science and Technology**. My academic journey has been supported by consistent Merit Scholarships and outstanding academic performance.

My research interests lie in **generative modeling**, particularly **diffusion models**, **multimodal large language models (MLLMs)**, and **reinforcement learning** applied to generative tasks. Iâ€™m currently focused on **visual reasoning**, **scene graph understanding**, and **latent reward fine-tuning** in video and image generation.


# ðŸ”¥ News
- *2025.05*: ðŸŽ‰ I am excited to join **Professor Zhijian Liu**'s lab! I will be working on the **UniGeneration** project, exploring unified generative frameworks across modalities.

# ðŸ”¬ Research Interests

My research focuses on:

- Generative models (Diffusion, VAE, Autoregressive)
- Multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
- Visual reasoning and scene graph understanding
- Reinforcement learning for generative optimization

# ðŸŽ– Honors and Awards
- Merit Scholarship, Sun Yat-sen University (2020â€“2024)

# ðŸ“– Educations
- *2024.09 - present*, M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (Machine Learning and Data Science), UC San Diego
- *2020.09 â€“ 2024.06*, B.Eng in Intelligent Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University

# ðŸ’» Internships
- **Internship at MBZUAI under Professor Xiaodan Liang** (2023-2024)\
  Conducted research on visual-language pretraining and representation alignment in multimodal learning.
- **Research Internship in Zhijian Liu's Lab at UCSD** (2025 â€“ Present)\
  Focused on unified generative modeling (UniGeneration), integrating vision and language with multimodal LLMs.
