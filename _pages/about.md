<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I’m a **M.S. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering (Machine Learning and Data Science)** at **UC San Diego**, where I focus on **Generative AI**, **Multimodal Reasoning**, and **AI Safety**. 
Previously, I earned my **B.Eng. in Intelligent Science and Technology** from **Sun Yat-sen University**, with a GPA of **3.8/4.0** (upper-division 4.0/4.0).

# 🔬 Research Interests

My research focuses on **multi-modal generation models**, particularly on **text, image, and video generation** to achieve semantic alignment and mutual enhancement between modalities.

Recently, I have been especially interested in **memory-augmented video generation**, exploring how retrieval and structured memory modules can improve **long-horizon consistency**, **physical plausibility**, and **content controllability** in generative models.

Looking forward, I aim to study **memory mechanisms in world models** and their integration with **VLA (Vision-Language-Action)** systems, enabling more reliable **embodied reasoning**, **interactive prediction**, and **agentic planning in dynamic environments**.

I am also interested in **unified generation and understanding models**, with the goal of building general-purpose frameworks that combine **multi-modal comprehension, reasoning, and generation** in a single architecture.

In addition, I am exploring **AI safety and robustness**, studying how large models can remain reliable and secure under adversarial or backdoor conditions.
